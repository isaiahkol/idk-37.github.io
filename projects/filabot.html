  <h2>Overview & Problem</h2>
  <p>
    The UVM FabLab recently acquired a Filabot Filament Recycler, so that we can reuse the material from failed or discarded prints.
    Since we use primarily Bambu Labs printers, we have many empty Bambu spools lying around, but unfortunately the stock attachment
    on the spooler module is designed for their own proprietary spools. It seemed foolish to invest in a filament recycler and then buy proprietary
    spools to use it, so I took on this project.
  </p>

  <!-- SOLUTION -->
  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>
    I designed a simple alternate attachment for the spooler (removing the stock one proved only minimally invasive) to work with Bambu,
    or really any other brand of spool with a similar internal diameter. Rather than the stock design which utilized a specific protrusion
    which fit into their spools, I opted for a threaded cylinder with a large wing nut style retainer. Finger-tight with my design was perfectly
    sufficient for eliminating the risk of spool slippage, and unlike the original design, there was now no risk of the spool being pulled off 
    by the traverse mechanism and unraveling on the floor.
  </p>

  <!-- PROCESS -->
  <h2>Design & Process</h2>
  <p>
    When I was first presented with this problem by the Operations Manager, I immediately took several photos of the spooler unit from all
    angles to clearly see where I would have interference to consider, and then took down basic dimensions. I then procured the .STL for the
    stock attachment, and printed a copy on my personal printer. Between the pictures, measurements, and physical duplicate I had just made,
    I was definetly in a good place to open up solidworks and begin drafting my own rendition. After experimenting with modifying the original
    fitting to remove the protrusion that blocked Bambu spools, I settled on just making my own version. I kept the retaining flanges and remade
    the center mounting design to ensure compatibility, but i replaced the tapered prongs with a threaded cylinder and large wing nut to keep the 
    spool locked in place. Once I was happy with the design, I printed it in PETG and hooked it up to the spooler.
  </p>

  <h2>Tools & Skills</h2>
  <p>
    CAD (SolidWorks) • 3D Printing • Prototyping • Fabrication • Testing
  </p>

  <!-- RESULTS -->
  <h2>Outcome</h2>
  <p>
    Overall, the attachment worked quite well! It fit perfectly onto the spooler unit, and when I put a Bambu spool on and set it up, I was able to
    successfully respool some loose filament we had. However, the threads were a little sticky, so I went back and adjusted tolerances, and I also
    increased infill from 15% to 20% as it felt like you could break it if you really tightened it as much as you could. After that, I set it
    back up and that is still what we have running on the Filabot. In a future rendition, I would like to reprint with multiple materials.
    I think if the first few layers of the wing nut were TPU 90A, I think it would have better grip on the spool and generally improve the design.

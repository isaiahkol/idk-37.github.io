  <h1>About</h1>
  <p class="lead">
  I’m a second-year mechanical engineering student at the University of Vermont with interests in aerospace, renewable energy, sustainability, and manufacturing. 
  <br>
  I’ve been using CAD software and 3D printing on my own equipment since I was about 13, and I was heavily involved in competitive robotics throughout high school. At UVM, I started as a technician and I now help run the FabLab, where I manage and operate 3D printers and other fabrication tools, assist students with technical projects, and support university research. 
  <br>
  Through these experiences, I have gained extensive firsthand experience designing mechanical systems, working within real constraints, and rapidly prototyping functional parts and assemblies. 
  <br>
  Outside of engineering, I enjoy biking, camping, skiing (even though I'm new to it), and spending time with my cat, Godzilla.
